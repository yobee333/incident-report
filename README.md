## Summary

I was given the assignment to create a working, online form using primarily HTML and CSS where the results were emailed to specific email addresses (email addresses have been removed for privacy). It is based off a printed PDF that they are currently using. I followed brand guidelines for styling. The form is responsive to make it easy for employees to access on their phones. Because this is an injury & illness incident report, I kept the styling minimal and straightforward. I have never met a safety department who appreciated "razzle-dazzle", and I thought it would be insensitive to the person filling it in if I tried to make it look "cool."

## Suggestions for Improvement

There are some changes I would make if I were to implement this for actual use. Since I am not a nurse or a safety director, my anatomy listings are pretty vague. I used a graphic with labels to reference in the selectors. A better option would be an anatomy picker that has already been built such as this one: https://www.humananatomyillustrations.com/human-anatomy-internal-external-illustration.html. Additionally, I would have used something more official for the signature such as Adobe Sign or DocuSign.
